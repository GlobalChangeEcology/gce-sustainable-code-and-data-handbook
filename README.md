# Sustainable Code & Data Handbook

Guidance, templates, and checklists for building durable, maintainable code and managing FAIR, reusable data in the natural sciences. Focus areas: code quality, environments, reproducible workflows, dataset documentation, publishing, and sustainability.

## About this Handbook
This handbook is designed for researchers in the natural sciences who want to improve their data and code management, reproducibility, and collaboration. While many examples are drawn from ecology, biology, and environmental science, the principles and tools described here are broadly applicable across scientific disciplines. The content is intentionally general so that teams in any institution can benefit and adapt the material to their own context.

## Why this exists
- Make code and data easier to maintain, review, and reuse
- Align with FAIR and good scientific practice
- Reduce risk and increase reproducibility across projects

## What’s inside
- Foundations & Motivation
- Data Management
- Code Management
- Reproducible Workflows
- Collaboration & Open Science
- Practical Tools & Hands-on Skills
 

## How to use
- Start new projects with a clear, consistent structure
- Create a dataset README and data dictionary for each dataset
- Keep raw data immutable; script all transformations
- Use Git/GitHub or GitLab, enable LFS or DVC for large files
- Publish cleaned data and code with a DOI at project milestones

## How to Adapt this Handbook
This handbook is designed to be flexible and adaptable for different research teams and scientific disciplines. To make it your own:

- **Customize templates and folder structures:** Adjust project templates, data dictionaries, and documentation examples to match your team’s workflows or field-specific requirements.
- **Add discipline-specific examples:** Insert code snippets or best practices relevant to your area of research (e.g., genomics, ecology, social sciences).
- **Expand or localize content:** Translate sections, add new chapters, or include local policies and resources as needed.
- **Contribute improvements:** Suggest changes or submit pull requests to help make the handbook better for everyone.

If you adapt this handbook for your own group, please consider sharing your improvements with the community!
