A template handbook for research teams: practical guidance, templates, and checklists for building durable, maintainable code and managing FAIR, reusable data. Focus areas: code quality, environments, reproducible workflows, dataset documentation, publishing, and sustainability.

## About this Handbook
This handbook is designed for researchers who want to improve their data and code management, reproducibility, and collaboration. The principles and tools described here are broadly applicable across scientific disciplines. The content is intentionally general so that teams at any institution can benefit and adapt the material to their own context.

## Why this exists
- Make code and data easier to maintain, review, and reuse
- Align with FAIR and good scientific practice
- Reduce risk and increase reproducibility across projects
- Provide a template that research groups can customize for their needs

## What’s inside
- Foundations & Motivation
- Data Management
- Code Management
- Reproducible Workflows
- Collaboration & Open Science
- Practical Tools & Hands-on Skills
 

## How to use
- Start new projects with a clear, consistent structure
- Create a dataset README and data dictionary for each dataset
- Keep raw data immutable; script all transformations
- Use Git/GitHub or GitLab, enable LFS or DVC for large files
- Publish cleaned data and code with a DOI at project milestones
