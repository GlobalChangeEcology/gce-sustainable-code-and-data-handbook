# Contributing

Thank you for improving the GCE Open Research Handbook! Please follow these guidelines so we can maintain quality and clarity.

## Ways to contribute
- Fix typos and clarify language
- Add or refine guidance with concrete, actionable steps
- Improve templates or add new ones (keep them minimal and general)
- Propose tool integrations and small CI examples

## Workflow
1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes with concise commits
3. Update relevant docs, lists, and cross-links
4. Open a Pull Request (PR) and request review from the Data Steward
5. Address feedback; squash and merge when approved

## Style
- Keep guidance concise and task-oriented
- Prefer Markdown and plaintext over binary formats
- Use ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD) and SI units
- For code examples, prefer Python or R and pin versions

## Templates
- Dataset-level README: `manual/templates/README_dataset.md`
- Data Dictionary: `manual/templates/data_dictionary.csv`
- DMP outline: `manual/templates/DMP_outline.md`
