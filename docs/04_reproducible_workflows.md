# 4. Reproducible Workflows

## 4.1 Introduction: From Scripts to Workflows

Managing code and data individually is essential, but reproducibility also depends on how they fit together. A scientific project is not just a dataset and a script — it is a sequence of interconnected steps: collect data, clean it, analyze it, visualize results, and generate outputs. This sequence is a workflow.

Without careful management, workflows are often fragile. A missing dependency, an undocumented software version, or a notebook run out of order can make it impossible to reproduce results. Reproducible workflows ensure that scientific outputs can be regenerated reliably, by you or by others, regardless of time or place (Sandve et al., 2013).

## 4.2 The Challenge of Computational Environments

One of the biggest barriers to reproducibility is the computational environment — the combination of software, libraries, operating system, and hardware on which code is run.

A script may work on the author’s laptop but fail on another computer because a package is missing or a version has changed.

Analyses may silently produce different results if underlying algorithms differ across versions of R, Python, or other software.

Documenting and managing environments is therefore a cornerstone of reproducibility.

## 4.3 Dependency Management

Modern research often relies on dozens of external packages and libraries. Keeping track of these dependencies is essential.

- In Python: use `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` files with Conda to record package versions.
- In R: use `renv` or `packrat` to snapshot dependencies.
- Cross-platform: use `pip freeze` or containerization tools.

Explicitly recording dependencies allows others to recreate the same software setup. Without this, code may break in unpredictable ways (Wilson et al., 2017).

---

## 4.4 Containers for Reproducibility

While dependency lists are helpful, they may still fail if underlying system libraries differ. Containers provide a stronger solution by packaging software and dependencies together.

- **Docker:** The most widely used containerization platform in science (Boettiger, 2015).
- **Singularity/Apptainer:** Designed for high-performance computing environments where Docker is not available.

Containers allow researchers to define an environment once and share it with others. A Dockerfile, for example, specifies all software versions needed. Running the container guarantees that the same environment is reproduced elsewhere.

**Example:**
A researcher publishes a bioinformatics pipeline as a Docker image. Others can download and run it without worrying about installing the right tools — ensuring reproducibility across labs.

## 4.5 Workflow Management Systems

Scientific analyses often consist of multiple steps: preprocessing, filtering, analysis, visualization. Running these steps manually increases the risk of mistakes. Workflow management systems automate the process, ensuring steps run in the correct order and are fully documented.

Popular options include:

- **Make:** A classic tool for automating builds, adapted for science.
- **Snakemake (Köster & Rahmann, 2012):** Inspired by Make, widely used in bioinformatics.
- **Nextflow (Di Tommaso et al., 2017):** Designed for scalable workflows on clusters and the cloud.
- **Common Workflow Language (CWL):** A standard for describing workflows.

These tools describe workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where each step depends on the outputs of previous steps. This ensures consistency and allows workflows to be resumed if interrupted.

## 4.6 Literate and Reproducible Reporting

A fully reproducible workflow does not stop at analysis — it extends to reporting. Literate programming combines code and narrative text, ensuring that figures, tables, and results are generated directly from the data.

- **RMarkdown and Quarto:** Integrate prose, code, and output.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Widely used for interactive analyses (Rule et al., 2019).
- **knitr (Xie, 2015):** Automates reproducible reports in R.

When manuscripts or reports are generated from the same workflow as the analyses, there is no risk of mismatched figures or “orphaned” results.

---

## 4.7 Best Practices for Workflow Reproducibility

Drawing on community guidelines (Sandve et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2017), best practices include:

- Keep raw data immutable — never overwrite it.
- Record every step — automate data cleaning and analysis.
- Track software versions — document environments.
- Use workflow managers to automate pipelines.
- Package environments in containers for portability.
- Generate reports programmatically from data and code.

Following these practices transforms a fragile workflow into a robust, transparent, and shareable system.

## 4.8 Reflection & Exercises

**Reflection:** Think of your current workflow. Could another researcher run it from start to finish without asking you questions? What would block them?

**Exercise:** Create a dependency file for one of your projects (`requirements.txt` in Python or `renv` in R).

**Exercise:** Containerize a simple script using Docker or Singularity.

**Discussion prompt:** What are the advantages and disadvantages of using workflow managers compared to manually running scripts?

## 4.9 Looking Ahead

So far, we have seen how data (Chapter 2), code (Chapter 3), and workflows (this chapter) can be managed for reproducibility. But reproducibility is not only about technical practices — it is also about collaboration and openness.

In the next chapter, we will explore how scientists can collaborate effectively, share their work, and embrace the principles of open science.
