# 5.2 Best Practices for Collaboration

Collaboration in computational research often fails not because of scientific disagreements, but because of logistical problems: files overwritten, undocumented steps, or confusion over versions. A few best practices can prevent these issues (Wilson et al., 2017):

- **Shared repositories:** Hosting code and data on GitHub, GitLab, or institutional servers.
- **Branching models:** Using Git branches for parallel work, then merging changes.
- **Code review:** Peer-reviewing each otherâ€™s scripts via pull requests.
- **Shared documentation:** Maintaining wikis, READMEs, or lab notebooks.
- **Clear communication:** Combining technical tools with regular check-ins.

These practices ensure that collaboration is efficient, transparent, and scalable.
