# 5.4 Licensing and Intellectual Property

Collaboration requires clarity about what can and cannot be reused. Without explicit licenses, reuse may be legally restricted.

- **For code:** Permissive licenses like MIT or Apache encourage reuse; copyleft licenses like GPL ensure derivative works remain open.
- **For data:** Creative Commons licenses (e.g., CC-BY, CC0) specify reuse conditions.
- **For publications:** Open-access licenses (e.g., CC-BY) maximize readership and impact.

Licensing choices should balance openness with the researcherâ€™s goals and responsibilities (Morin et al., 2012).
