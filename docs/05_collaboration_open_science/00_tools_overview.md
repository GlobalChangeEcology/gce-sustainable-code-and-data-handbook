|--------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| GitHub       | Widely used, integrates with CI, free for public/private, great docs | Owned by Microsoft, some privacy concerns |
| GitLab       | Open source, self-hosting possible, good CI/CD | Slightly steeper learning curve   |
| Institutional| May meet data/privacy requirements, local support | Often less user-friendly, limited features |
| Shared Drives| Simple, good for non-code files           | No version control, risk of overwrites |
| Overleaf     | Collaborative LaTeX writing, versioning   | Not for code/data, limited to writing |
