# 5.3 Principles of Open Science

Open science extends the ethos of collaboration to the entire research ecosystem. Its principles include (Vicente-Saez & Martinez-Fuentes, 2018):

- **Open access:** Making publications freely available.
- **Open data:** Sharing datasets under FAIR principles.
- **Open code:** Releasing software with clear licenses.
- **Open peer review:** Transparent and constructive evaluation.
- **Citizen science:** Involving the public in research.

Open science is not simply about “sharing everything” — it is about making research outputs as open as possible, as closed as necessary (Fecher & Friesike, 2014).
