# 5.5 Publishing Reproducible Research

Traditional publications often separate narrative, data, and code â€” leaving gaps that make replication difficult. Reproducible publishing integrates them:

- Linking articles to datasets in repositories (via DOIs).
- Linking figures to the code that generated them.
- Using tools like RMarkdown, Quarto, or Jupyter Book to publish documents where code and results are embedded.

Some journals now require data and code availability statements, while platforms such as ReScience and F1000Research explicitly support reproducible publications (Stodden et al., 2016).
