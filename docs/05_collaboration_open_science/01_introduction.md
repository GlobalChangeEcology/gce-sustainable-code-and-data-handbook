# 5.1 Introduction: Science as a Collaborative Enterprise

Science has always been collaborative. From the earliest letters exchanged between natural philosophers to the massive international collaborations in modern physics and genomics, progress depends on researchers building on each otherâ€™s work.

In the digital era, collaboration increasingly depends on how we manage and share code, data, and workflows. Good practices not only make individual projects reproducible, but also make them accessible to others. This aligns with the principles of open science: the movement to make research transparent, accessible, and reusable for the benefit of the scientific community and society at large (Nielsen, 2011).
