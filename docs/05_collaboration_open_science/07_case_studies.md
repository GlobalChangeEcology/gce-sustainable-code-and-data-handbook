# 5.7 Case Studies

- **The Human Genome Project:** One of the first large-scale efforts where open data sharing accelerated discovery worldwide (Collins et al., 2003).
- **COVID-19 pandemic:** Rapid, open sharing of viral genomes and epidemiological data enabled unprecedented global collaboration (Kupferschmidt, 2020).
- **ReScience journal:** Publishes replications of existing computational studies, with full code and data (Rougier et al., 2017).

These examples illustrate how openness can transform both the speed and reliability of science.
