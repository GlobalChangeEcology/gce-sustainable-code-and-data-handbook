# 5.6 Incentives and Barriers to Open Collaboration

Although open science has clear benefits, adoption is uneven. Incentives include increased visibility, more citations (Piwowar & Vision, 2013), and greater scientific impact.

Barriers include:

- Fear of being “scooped.”
- Lack of recognition in traditional academic metrics.
- Concerns about data misuse or misinterpretation.
- Additional time and effort required.

Cultural change, institutional policies, and recognition systems are crucial to making open collaboration the norm.
