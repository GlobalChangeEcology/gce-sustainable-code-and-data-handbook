# 5.8 Reflection & Exercises

**Reflection:** Think of a time when collaboration in your research was slowed down by poor communication or organization. How could better practices have helped?

**Exercise:** Add a license file (e.g., MIT, GPL, or CC-BY) to one of your projects. Explain your choice.

**Exercise:** Explore an open dataset in your field (e.g., from Zenodo or Dryad). What metadata and documentation make it usable? What is missing?

**Discussion prompt:** What trade-offs exist between openness and protecting sensitive or competitive data?
