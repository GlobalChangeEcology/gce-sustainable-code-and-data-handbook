# Start Here

Welcome! This handbook helps you set up sustainable code and FAIR, reusable data. If you’ve never done this before, follow the path below.

## Your first project in 30 minutes
1. Create the project folders (copy from Project Setup).
2. Add a dataset `README.md` and `data_dictionary.csv` from templates.
3. Put raw data in `01_RAWDATA/` (don’t edit it). Work in `03_CLEAN/`.
4. Initialize Git. Commit often. Enable LFS for big files.
5. Capture your environment (Conda/renv). Save it in the repo.
6. Run the QA checklist before sharing or publishing.

## What to read next
