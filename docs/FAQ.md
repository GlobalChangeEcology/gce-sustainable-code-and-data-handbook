# FAQ — Common Questions

## I only have Excel. Is that okay?
Yes. Save to CSV for analysis and keep your original Excel files as raw. Document steps you take in Excel in the README.

## Do I have to learn Git?
It’s strongly recommended. Start with: commit, branch, pull request. It pays off quickly when collaborating.

## What if my data are sensitive?
See Sensitive Data. You may need anonymization and restricted access; talk to the Data Steward early.

## Which repository should I publish to?
Use Zenodo for general data/code. PANGAEA for environmental datasets, GBIF for biodiversity occurrences. Ask if unsure.

## How do I cite my dataset?
Mint a DOI (e.g., via Zenodo). Include the citation in your README and publications.
