# Why Version Control?

## The Problem

Without version control, researchers often face:

- “Where is this script we used in the last project?”
- “Which version of the script is the right one?”
- “I accidentally overwrote a file.”
- “Where’s the latest data?”
- “Who changed what, and why?”

These issues slow down research, cause mistakes, and make collaboration difficult.

## Why use Git/GitHub?

Version control systems like Git (and platforms like GitHub) solve these problems by enabling:

1. **Track Changes:** See what changed and when.
2. **Collaborate:** Work with others seamlessly.
3. **Backup:** Save your work automatically (with GitHub).
4. **Reproducibility:** Ensure your research can be repeated.
5. **Share:** Publish your work with the world.

Version control is a foundation for reproducible, collaborative, and fearless coding in science.
