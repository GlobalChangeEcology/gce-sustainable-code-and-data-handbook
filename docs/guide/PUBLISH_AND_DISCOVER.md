# Publish and Make Findable

In this lesson you will publish a versioned dataset, get a DOI, connect it to your code, and check findability.

Outcomes

- GitHub release created and linked; CITATION.cff present
- Landing page has plain‑language summary and usage example
- Optional: machine‑readable JSON‑LD added to the project site

Do it
- Follow Deposit & Validation Recipes to prepare and submit
- Add cross‑links (dataset DOI ↔ GitHub release)
- Use the Beginner guide on Findability & Discovery to check your record quality

Checklist
- [ ] Repository is discipline‑appropriate
- [ ] Metadata fields complete (title, abstract, keywords, ORCID, funding)
- [ ] Provenance and software cited
- [ ] Versioned release and DOI present
- [ ] Optional JSON‑LD added if you have a website
