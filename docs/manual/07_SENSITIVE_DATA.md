# 07 â€” Sensitive Data

## Definitions & Scope
- Personal data (GDPR), confidential agreements, sensitive locations/species.
- Classify datasets: Public / Internal / Restricted.

## Legal & Ethical Basis
- Ensure lawful basis (consent, contract, public interest) and ethics approvals.
- Data minimisation: collect only what is necessary.

## Protection Measures
- Access control: group-based permissions on NAS/Nextcloud/GitLab.
- Pseudonymisation/anonymisation where feasible; store keys separately.
- Encryption at rest (infrastructure) and in transit (TLS); avoid email attachments.

## Retention & Deletion
- Define retention periods; document in project metadata.
- Secure deletion on request/expiry; record in a deletion log.

## Sharing & Publication
- Remove direct identifiers; evaluate re-identification risk.
- Use controlled-access repositories if needed; specify data use agreements.

## Handling decision guide

| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| Contains direct identifiers (name, SSN, email) | Remove or irreversibly anonymize before sharing |
| Contains quasi-identifiers (DOB, ZIP, coords) | Aggregate/generalize; assess re-identification risk |
| Small groups (<10) | Consider suppression or noise addition |
| Legal/contractual restrictions | Keep restricted; share metadata only |

## PII checklist (quick)
- Identify direct and indirect identifiers
- Define lawful basis/consent; document in DMP
- Minimize data collected; keep only necessary fields
- Apply anonymization/pseudonymization standards
- Control access; log who can read the raw data
- Share safe derivatives plus rich metadata
