# What is GitHub?

## A Platform for Collaboration and Hosting

GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git. It provides tools for:

- **Hosting repositories:** Store your code and project files in the cloud.
- **Collaboration:** Work with others through pull requests, issues, and discussions.
- **Version control:** Track changes and manage your project history.
- **Automation:** Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows.
- **Publishing:** Host websites and documentation with GitHub Pages.

## Application in Ecology

Practical ways GitHub powers open ecological research:

| Research Challenge   | How GitHub Helps |
|----------------------|------------------|
| Reproducibility      | GitHub stores code, data, and history. Zenodo adds DOIs for citation. |
| Project continuity   | Version control tracks progress. GitHub Projects coordinate teams. |
| Collaboration        | Pull requests enable contributions. CI ensures reproducibility. |
| Peer review          | Issues and Discussions allow transparent feedback and debate. |
| Publishing           | Write in Markdown/LaTeX. GitHub Pages hosts websites or docs. |
