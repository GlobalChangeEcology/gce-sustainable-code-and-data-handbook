# 2.10 Reflection & Exercises

**Reflection:** Could someone outside your lab use your dataset without asking you questions? If not, what key information is missing?

**Exercise:** Take one of your datasets and write a README file describing how it was collected, what each variable means, and any preprocessing performed.

**Exercise:** Reorganize one of your data folders into a logical structure with raw/processed separation and meaningful filenames.
