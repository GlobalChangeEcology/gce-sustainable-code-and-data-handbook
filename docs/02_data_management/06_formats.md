# 2.6 Choosing Data Formats

The choice of file format can determine whether data remains usable over time. Proprietary formats (such as some versions of Excel) may not be supported in the future, or may not be accessible without specific software. Open, non-proprietary formats are safer.

- **Tabular data:** CSV (comma-separated values) is widely supported.
- **Hierarchical data:** JSON or XML allow structured representation.
- **Large, multidimensional data:** NetCDF or HDF5 are standards in climate and physics.

Using standardized, open formats supports interoperability and long-term preservation (Wilkinson et al., 2016).
