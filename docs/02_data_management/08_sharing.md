# 2.8 Sharing and Licensing Data

Sharing data increases transparency and amplifies scientific impact. Studies show that articles with openly shared datasets receive more citations than those without (Piwowar & Vision, 2013).

To share responsibly, data should be accompanied by a license specifying how it may be reused. Common options include:

- **Creative Commons (CC-BY):** requires attribution but allows reuse.
- **CC0 (public domain dedication):** no restrictions.
- **Open Data Commons licenses:** tailored to datasets.

Clear licensing prevents legal ambiguity and encourages reuse.
