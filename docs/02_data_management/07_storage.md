# 2.7 Storing and Preserving Data

Good storage practices protect against data loss. A widely cited rule is the 3–2–1 backup strategy: keep three copies of your data, on at least two different types of media, with one copy offsite.

It is also critical to separate raw data (immutable) from processed data (derived from cleaning or transformations). Raw data should never be overwritten.

For long-term preservation, researchers can deposit datasets in:

- Institutional repositories (university libraries).
- Discipline-specific repositories (e.g., GenBank for genetic data).
- Generalist repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Dryad, Figshare).

Depositing data in a trusted repository ensures it remains accessible long after a project ends.
