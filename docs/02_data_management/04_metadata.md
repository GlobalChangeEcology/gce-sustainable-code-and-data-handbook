# 2.4 Metadata and Documentation

Data without context is often useless. Metadata — information about the data — provides the “who, what, where, when, and how” needed to make sense of files.

At a minimum, every dataset should have a README file describing:

- Who collected the data.
- When and where it was collected.
- What each variable or column represents.
- The units of measurement.
- Any processing steps already performed.

More formal metadata standards, such as Dublin Core or the DataCite schema, provide structured ways of describing datasets for sharing and archiving. A data dictionary, listing and defining each variable, is especially helpful. Without it, a column labeled `val1` may remain forever mysterious.
