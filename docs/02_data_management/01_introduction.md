# 2.1 Introduction: The Central Role of Data

In every scientific field, data is the raw material from which discoveries are made. Without data, hypotheses cannot be tested, models cannot be built, and knowledge cannot be advanced. Yet the value of data depends not only on how it is collected but also on how it is managed.

Poorly managed data can easily become meaningless: files may be lost, misnamed, corrupted, or rendered unusable because the context needed to interpret them was never recorded. Conversely, well-managed data remains useful far beyond the lifespan of a single project. It can be reanalyzed, combined with other datasets, and reused in ways the original researcher never imagined (White et al., 2013).

Good data management is therefore not an afterthought. It is a central practice of modern science â€” one that supports reproducibility, transparency, and collaboration.
