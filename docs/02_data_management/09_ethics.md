# 2.9 Ethics, Privacy, and Legal Issues

Not all data can or should be openly shared. Research involving human subjects, medical records, or other sensitive information requires careful attention to privacy and consent.

- **Anonymization:** Removing identifiers to protect participant privacy.
- **Controlled access:** Depositing data in repositories with restricted access mechanisms.
- **Legal frameworks:** Laws such as the EUâ€™s GDPR or the US HIPAA impose strict rules on handling personal data.

Good data management balances openness with responsibility to protect participants and comply with regulations.
