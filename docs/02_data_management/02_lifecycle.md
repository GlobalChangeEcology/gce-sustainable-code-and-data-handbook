# 2.2 The Data Lifecycle

One way to think about data management is through the data lifecycle. Data typically passes through several stages:

- **Collection:** Gathering raw observations, measurements, or outputs from simulations.
- **Storage:** Saving and organizing the raw data in a secure way.
- **Cleaning and processing:** Correcting errors, transforming formats, and preparing data for analysis.
- **Analysis:** Applying statistical or computational methods.
- **Sharing:** Making data available to collaborators or the public.
- **Preservation:** Archiving data for long-term access and reuse.

At each stage, decisions about management have lasting effects. For example, failing to document units during collection can make later analysis impossible, while poor archiving can mean data disappears altogether. Planning ahead is crucial (Michener, 2015).
