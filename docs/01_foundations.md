Modern science increasingly relies on computational methods. From sequencing genomes, to modeling climate change, to analyzing survey data, researchers today handle vast quantities of data and write custom code to process and interpret it. Yet while the scientific community has centuries of experience managing physical experiments with careful lab notebooks, we are still learning how best to manage code and data.

Too often, the details of how results are generated are left in messy folders, undocumented scripts, or on a single researcher’s laptop. When others try to reproduce the work — or even when the original researcher revisits it months later — results cannot be recreated. This is not a trivial inconvenience: it threatens the very foundation of scientific credibility (Peng, 2011).

## 1.1 Introduction: Why This Matters

Good code and data management is as essential to modern science as careful pipetting or precise measurements were to earlier generations. Imagine trying to repeat your own analysis after two years—would you remember every step? Many scientists can’t, and this is part of a bigger problem: the reproducibility crisis.

## 1.2 The Reproducibility Crisis and the Role of Computation

Over the past two decades, numerous fields have confronted what has been called the “reproducibility crisis.”

- In psychology, a large-scale replication study found that fewer than half of published results could be reproduced (Open Science Collaboration, 2015).
- In cancer biology, an initiative attempting to replicate 50 landmark studies confirmed only a fraction of them (Begley & Ellis, 2012).
- Surveys of working scientists across disciplines show widespread concern about reproducibility, with over 70% reporting they had failed to reproduce another scientist’s experiments, and more than half unable to reproduce their own (Baker, 2016).

Traditionally, reproducibility was about physical experiments — repeating the same protocol with the same reagents. Today, however, methods often include code (scripts, pipelines, models) and data (raw measurements, curated datasets, simulation outputs). If these are not managed properly, reproducing results becomes impossible.

Good code and data management is therefore not optional. It is as essential to modern science as careful pipetting or precise measurements were to earlier generations.

## 1.3 Key Concepts: Repeatability, Reproducibility, Replicability

It is useful to distinguish between three related but distinct ideas (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019):

- **Repeatability:** The same researcher, using the same data and methods, gets the same results.
- **Reproducibility:** A different researcher, using the same data and methods, gets the same results.
- **Replicability:** A different researcher, using new data and the same methods, obtains consistent results.

In computational science, reproducibility is the baseline expectation: if you share your code and data, others should be able to recreate your results exactly. Good management practices make this possible (Goodman et al., 2016).

## 1.4 The FAIR Principles for Data

The international research community has articulated the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016), which describe what makes data well-prepared for sharing and reuse:

- **Findable:** Data should be assigned unique identifiers (such as DOIs) and described with searchable metadata.
- **Accessible:** Data should be retrievable using open, standardized protocols, with clear conditions for access.
- **Interoperable:** Data should use open formats and standardized vocabularies, so it can integrate with other data and tools.
- **Reusable:** Data should include rich documentation, clear provenance, and licensing terms that allow reuse.

> **Example:**
> Imagine a researcher shares a dataset as an Excel file named `final_data.xlsx` with columns labeled A, B, and C. Another researcher would struggle to use it — it is neither findable (no DOI), nor interoperable (Excel is a proprietary format), nor reusable (no documentation).
>
> In contrast, the same dataset shared as a CSV file with descriptive column names, a README file explaining variables, metadata describing the context, and a DOI in a repository such as Zenodo is fully aligned with FAIR.

## 1.5 Common Pitfalls in Research Projects

Most researchers have seen — or been guilty of — at least some of these habits (Sandve et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2017):

- **Data only on a laptop:** risks loss, and makes collaboration impossible.
- **Messy file naming:** `data_final.csv`, `data_final2.csv`, `data_reallyfinal.csv` — no clear record of which file produced the results.
- **Manual edits:** changing values directly in spreadsheets without documenting them — steps cannot be reproduced.
- **Undocumented code:** scripts with cryptic names (`script1.py`, `new_script.R`) and no explanation.
- **Missing dependencies:** code that only works on the original machine because software versions are not recorded.

These practices make research fragile and irreproducible. They also waste time — not only for others, but for the original researcher who later cannot recall what was done.

## 1.6 A Positive Vision: What Good Practice Enables

When code and data are managed well, the benefits are immediate and far-reaching:

- **Efficiency:** You can easily revisit past work and build on it.
- **Collaboration:** Colleagues and students can contribute without confusion.
- **Transparency:** Reviewers and readers can see exactly how results were generated.
- **Scalability:** Large, complex projects remain organized and maintainable.
- **Legacy:** Work remains usable long after the original researcher moves on.

Increasingly, journals, funders, and institutions are recognizing these benefits and requiring data and code sharing. But beyond compliance, good practice simply makes research better (Peng, 2011).

## 1.7 Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives

Although the challenges look different across fields, the principles apply universally:

- **Biology:** Sharing sequencing datasets with clear metadata enables others to validate findings and perform meta-analyses.
- **Climate science:** Managing simulation outputs with standardized formats allows results to be compared across models.
- **Social sciences:** Well-documented survey data lets other researchers test new hypotheses without collecting new data.

Regardless of field, the goal is the same: science that others can understand, trust, and reuse.

---

## 1.8 Reflection & Exercises

**Reflection:** Think about your current or most recent project. If you handed your raw data and analysis scripts to a colleague, could they reproduce your results without asking you questions? Why or why not?

**Exercise:** Open one of your own datasets or scripts from six months ago. How easy is it to understand what it contains and how it was used? Write down two improvements you could make to increase clarity and reproducibility.

**Discussion prompt:** What are the costs — for individual researchers and for science as a whole — when projects are irreproducible?

## 1.9 Looking Ahead

This chapter has laid the foundation by showing why code and data management are essential to credible, efficient, and collaborative science. In the next chapters, we will move from principles to practice:

- **Chapter 2:** How to manage data responsibly and reproducibly.
- **Chapter 3:** Best practices for managing code, including documentation and version control.
- **Later chapters:** Bringing everything together into fully reproducible research workflows.

The journey begins here: by recognizing that managing code and data is not extra work, but a fundamental part of doing good science.
