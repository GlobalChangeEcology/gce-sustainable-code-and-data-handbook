# 3. Code Management

Writing scientific code:
- Readability (style guides, naming conventions).
- Modularity & reusability (functions, scripts vs notebooks, packages).
- Documentation (inline comments, docstrings, READMEs).

Version control with Git:
- Basics: commits, branches, merging.
- Collaboration: pull requests, code review.
- Platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.

Notebooks vs scripts: when to use Jupyter/RMarkdown vs standalone scripts.

Automation: Makefiles, Snakemake, Nextflow for reproducible workflows.

Testing: unit tests, continuous integration for scientific code.
