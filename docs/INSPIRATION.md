# Inspirations: Great Guides To Learn From

Below is a curated set of authoritative, living resources on research software, reproducible workflows, and research data management. Each entry includes a one‑line takeaway we can adapt here. We link and paraphrase rather than copy; please respect original licenses when reusing.

## Exemplar Guides

- The Turing Way — Community handbook for reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science. Takeaway: modular “pick-what-you-need” chapters, strong community onboarding, and visual summaries. https://the-turing-way.org/
- ELIXIR RDMkit — Task/role/domain‑based RDM navigation plus “tool assemblies.” Takeaway: browse by lifecycle, role, and domain; provide concrete tool stacks. https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/
- FAIR Software: Five Recommendations — Repository, License, Registry, Citation, Checklist. Takeaway: a simple, actionable 5‑item checklist for software. https://fair-software.eu/
- Good Research Code Handbook — Pragmatic coding practices for researchers. Takeaway: opinionated, beginner‑friendly checklists for project setup, testing, docs. https://goodresearch.dev/
- DataLad Handbook — Narrative + hands‑on use cases for data versioning at scale. Takeaway: “use cases” and copy‑paste code lists; git-annex concepts explained clearly. https://handbook.datalad.org/
- UK Data Service RDM — Deep guidance on consent, anonymisation, rights, and documentation with interactive modules. Takeaway: checklists for ethics and legal compliance. https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/
- Dataverse Guides — End‑to‑end dataset deposit, metadata, APIs. Takeaway: clear “how to deposit and cite” recipes we can mirror. https://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/
- Pangeo — Community patterns for cloud‑native, scalable geoscience (Zarr, Dask, Xarray, Kerchunk). Takeaway: cloud‑ready data formats and catalogs. https://pangeo.io/

## Concrete Enhancements We Can Adopt

1) Add “By Role” landing (PI, Data steward, Early‑career): quick links into relevant pages (inspired by RDMkit Your role).
2) Create “Tool Assemblies” pages: recommended stacks for small/medium/large projects (RDMkit assemblies; Pangeo ecosystem for geoscience).
3) Ethics & Consent checklist page with links to anonymisation modules (UKDS) and sample consent language; cross‑link from Guided Project Phase 1.
4) Software 5‑Recommendations callout in Software Practices: repository, license, registry, citation, checklist (FAIR-Software.eu).
5) Deposit recipes: Zenodo and Dataverse “Do it” steps with metadata fields needed and JSON‑LD block (Dataverse guides + our Dataset JSON‑LD).
6) Data versioning advanced example: mini DataLad walk‑through and a DVC comparison note; link from Data Versioning page.
