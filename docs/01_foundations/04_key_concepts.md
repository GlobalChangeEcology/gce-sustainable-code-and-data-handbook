## 1.3 Key Concepts: Repeatability, Reproducibility, Replicability

It is useful to distinguish between three related but distinct ideas (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019):

- **Repeatability:** The same researcher, using the same data and methods, gets the same results.
- **Reproducibility:** A different researcher, using the same data and methods, gets the same results.
- **Replicability:** A different researcher, using new data and the same methods, obtains consistent results.

In computational science, reproducibility is the baseline expectation: if you share your code and data, others should be able to recreate your results exactly. Good management practices make this possible (Goodman et al., 2016).
