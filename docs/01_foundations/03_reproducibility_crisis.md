## 1.2 The Reproducibility Crisis and the Role of Computation

Over the past two decades, numerous fields have confronted what has been called the “reproducibility crisis.”

- In psychology, a large-scale replication study found that fewer than half of published results could be reproduced (Open Science Collaboration, 2015).
- In cancer biology, an initiative attempting to replicate 50 landmark studies confirmed only a fraction of them (Begley & Ellis, 2012).
- Surveys of working scientists across disciplines show widespread concern about reproducibility, with over 70% reporting they had failed to reproduce another scientist’s experiments, and more than half unable to reproduce their own (Baker, 2016).

Traditionally, reproducibility was about physical experiments — repeating the same protocol with the same reagents. Today, however, methods often include code (scripts, pipelines, models) and data (raw measurements, curated datasets, simulation outputs). If these are not managed properly, reproducing results becomes impossible.

Good code and data management is therefore not optional. It is as essential to modern science as careful pipetting or precise measurements were to earlier generations.
