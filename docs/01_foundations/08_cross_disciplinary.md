## 1.7 Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives

Although the challenges look different across fields, the principles apply universally:

- **Biology:** Sharing sequencing datasets with clear metadata enables others to validate findings and perform meta-analyses.
- **Climate science:** Managing simulation outputs with standardized formats allows results to be compared across models.
- **Social sciences:** Well-documented survey data lets other researchers test new hypotheses without collecting new data.

Regardless of field, the goal is the same: science that others can understand, trust, and reuse.
