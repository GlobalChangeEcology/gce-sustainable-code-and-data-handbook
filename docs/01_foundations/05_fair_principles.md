## 1.4 The FAIR Principles for Data

The international research community has articulated the FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016), which describe what makes data well-prepared for sharing and reuse:

- **Findable:** Data should be assigned unique identifiers (such as DOIs) and described with searchable metadata.
- **Accessible:** Data should be retrievable using open, standardized protocols, with clear conditions for access.
- **Interoperable:** Data should use open formats and standardized vocabularies, so it can integrate with other data and tools.
- **Reusable:** Data should include rich documentation, clear provenance, and licensing terms that allow reuse.

> **Example:**
> Imagine a researcher shares a dataset as an Excel file named `final_data.xlsx` with columns labeled A, B, and C. Another researcher would struggle to use it â€” it is neither findable (no DOI), nor interoperable (Excel is a proprietary format), nor reusable (no documentation).
>
> In contrast, the same dataset shared as a CSV file with descriptive column names, a README file explaining variables, metadata describing the context, and a DOI in a repository such as Zenodo is fully aligned with FAIR.
