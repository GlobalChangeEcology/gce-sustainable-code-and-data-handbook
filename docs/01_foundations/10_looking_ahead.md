## 1.9 Looking Ahead

This chapter has laid the foundation by showing why code and data management are essential to credible, efficient, and collaborative science. In the next chapters, we will move from principles to practice:

- **Chapter 2:** How to manage data responsibly and reproducibly.
- **Chapter 3:** Best practices for managing code, including documentation and version control.
- **Later chapters:** Bringing everything together into fully reproducible research workflows.

The journey begins here: by recognizing that managing code and data is not extra work, but a fundamental part of doing good science.
