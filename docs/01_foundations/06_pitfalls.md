## 1.5 Common Pitfalls in Research Projects

Most researchers have seen — or been guilty of — at least some of these habits (Sandve et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2017):

- **Data only on a laptop:** risks loss, and makes collaboration impossible.
- **Messy file naming:** `data_final.csv`, `data_final2.csv`, `data_reallyfinal.csv` — no clear record of which file produced the results.
- **Manual edits:** changing values directly in spreadsheets without documenting them — steps cannot be reproduced.
- **Undocumented code:** scripts with cryptic names (`script1.py`, `new_script.R`) and no explanation.
- **Missing dependencies:** code that only works on the original machine because software versions are not recorded.

These practices make research fragile and irreproducible. They also waste time — not only for others, but for the original researcher who later cannot recall what was done.
