# 1. Foundations & Motivation

Science is increasingly computational. We wrangle data, write code, and stitch together tools to answer questions. Yet our digital lab notebooks—folders, scripts, and spreadsheets—often lack the structure and care we expect in the physical lab. The result: time lost, results that can’t be reproduced, and knowledge that’s hard to share.

This chapter lays the groundwork for a different experience: one where your future self (and your collaborators) can easily pick up your work, re-run it, and extend it with confidence.

## At a glance

- What you’ll gain: mental models, baseline practices, and a clear path to level up your research workflows.
- What this is not: a tool-first manual. We focus on principles and decisions that make specific tools work for you.
- Who this is for: researchers who write code, collect or analyze data, supervise teams, or steward projects over time.

## Running case study: A real project, two outcomes

We’ll follow a small, realistic project throughout the handbook: a dataset of field measurements and a simple analysis. We contrast two paths:

- Path A (ad hoc): files named “final_v3.xlsx,” scripts that only run on one laptop, missing notes.
- Path B (sustainable): clear structure, version control, minimal documentation, and reproducible runs.

At each step, we’ll show how modest choices lead to radically different outcomes—saving hours now and months later.

## How this chapter fits

- Section 1 sets shared language and motivation (you’re here).
- Sections 2–3 frame common pitfalls and practical principles.
- Later chapters build on this: data management (2), code management (3), reproducible workflows (4), collaboration (5), and hands‑on tools (6).

## What success looks like

- You can articulate why reproducibility and sustainability matter for your research and career.
- You have a mental model for organizing projects and making decisions under constraints.
- You see a path to start small—improving one project this week—without boiling the ocean.

Next: why this matters—for your time, your team, and your science.
