# 1. Foundations & Motivation

Modern science increasingly relies on computational methods. From sequencing genomes, to modeling climate change, to analyzing survey data, researchers today handle vast quantities of data and write custom code to process and interpret it. Yet while the scientific community has centuries of experience managing physical experiments with careful lab notebooks, we are still learning how best to manage code and data.

Too often, the details of how results are generated are left in messy folders, undocumented scripts, or on a single researcher’s laptop. When others try to reproduce the work — or even when the original researcher revisits it months later — results cannot be recreated. This is not a trivial inconvenience: it threatens the very foundation of scientific credibility (Peng, 2011).
