# GCE Department Context: Unique Challenges

The Global Change Ecology (GCE) department faces several data and code management challenges that are common in interdisciplinary, field-based research:

- **Field Data Complexity:** Data is often collected in remote locations, sometimes with limited internet or power, leading to inconsistent formats and delayed uploads.
- **Interdisciplinary Teams:** Projects frequently involve ecologists, data scientists, and external collaborators, each with different workflows and technical backgrounds.
- **Long-term Projects:** Many studies span years or decades, requiring careful documentation so that future team members can understand and reproduce past work.
- **Sensitive Data:** Some datasets include sensitive species locations or personal information, demanding extra care in storage and sharing.
- **Data Volume and Variety:** GCE research generates everything from small spreadsheets to large sensor datasets, images, and model outputs.

Addressing these challenges requires robust, flexible, and well-documented data and code management practicesâ€”this handbook is designed to help you meet them.
