# Research Context: Common Challenges

Modern research departments face several data and code management challenges that are common across disciplines and institutions:

- **Data Complexity:** Data is often collected across diverse environments and conditions, sometimes with limited connectivity or standardization, leading to inconsistent formats and quality issues.
- **Interdisciplinary Teams:** Projects frequently involve researchers from different fields, data scientists, and external collaborators, each with different workflows and technical backgrounds.
- **Long-term Projects:** Many studies span years or decades, requiring careful documentation so that future team members can understand and reproduce past work.
- **Sensitive Data:** Some datasets include confidential information, personal data, or sensitive locations, demanding extra care in storage and sharing.
- **Data Volume and Variety:** Research generates everything from small spreadsheets to large sensor datasets, images, simulations, and model outputs.

Addressing these challenges requires robust, flexible, and well-documented data and code management practicesâ€”this handbook is designed to help you meet them.
