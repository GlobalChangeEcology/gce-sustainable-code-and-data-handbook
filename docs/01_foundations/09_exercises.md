## 1.8 Reflection & Exercises

**Reflection:** Think about your current or most recent project. If you handed your raw data and analysis scripts to a colleague, could they reproduce your results without asking you questions? Why or why not?

**Exercise:** Open one of your own datasets or scripts from six months ago. How easy is it to understand what it contains and how it was used? Write down two improvements you could make to increase clarity and reproducibility.

**Discussion prompt:** What are the costs — for individual researchers and for science as a whole — when projects are irreproducible?
