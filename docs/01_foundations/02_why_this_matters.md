## 1.1 Why This Matters

Better code and data practices aren’t busywork—they buy you time, credibility, and impact.

### Outcomes you’ll feel in 30–60 days
- Less rework: fewer “where did that file go?” hours.
- Faster onboarding: new team members get productive in days, not weeks.
- Safer iteration: you can try ideas without breaking what works.
- Sharper papers: methods and results are easier to verify and extend.

### Stakeholder perspectives
- You (analyst): confidence you can recreate a figure from raw data on a new laptop.
- Your PI/collaborators: a project that survives turnover and supports reuse.
- Reviewers/journals: transparent methods that build trust.
- Future you: reduced cognitive load; nothing “only lives in your head.”

### The hidden costs of ad hoc
- Siloed knowledge: critical steps exist only in memory or notebooks.
- Fragile results: one environment change breaks the whole analysis.
- Lost time: manual steps repeated across projects and people.

### Quick wins to start this week
1. Create a minimal project structure with separate raw/processed data.
2. Track your analysis code with Git; commit at logical milestones.
3. Add a README that explains how to run the analysis end‑to‑end.
4. Record one decision log per week: what changed and why.

These small steps compound. They’re the difference between Path A and Path B in our running case study—and they make the rest of this handbook far more effective.
