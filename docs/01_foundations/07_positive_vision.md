## 1.6 A Positive Vision: What Good Practice Enables

When code and data are managed well, the benefits are immediate and far-reaching:

- **Efficiency:** You can easily revisit past work and build on it.
- **Collaboration:** Colleagues and students can contribute without confusion.
- **Transparency:** Reviewers and readers can see exactly how results were generated.
- **Scalability:** Large, complex projects remain organized and maintainable.
- **Legacy:** Work remains usable long after the original researcher moves on.

Increasingly, journals, funders, and institutions are recognizing these benefits and requiring data and code sharing. But beyond compliance, good practice simply makes research better (Peng, 2011).
