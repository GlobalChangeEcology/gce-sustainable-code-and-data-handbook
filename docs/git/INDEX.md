# Git & GitHub — Guide

A practical, opinionated guide for everyday Git and GitHub use in GCE projects.

- Concepts: commits, branches, remotes, and history
- Workflow: feature branches, PRs, reviews, releases
- Config: editors, difftools, signing, defaults
- Collaboration: branching model, branch protection, CODEOWNERS
