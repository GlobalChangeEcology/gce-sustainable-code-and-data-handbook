# 7. Case Studies & Applications

## 7.1 Introduction: Learning from Real Projects

The principles and tools of reproducible science often feel abstract until they are applied to real research. Case studies provide concrete examples of how code and data management, reproducible workflows, and open collaboration are practiced across disciplines. They also highlight the challenges researchers face and the solutions that work in practice.

This chapter presents examples from different scientific domains, showing how reproducibility can be embedded in daily research, and what lessons we can learn from successes and failures.

## 7.2 Biology: Reproducible Genomics Pipelines

Genomics research generates vast amounts of sequencing data, requiring complex pipelines for alignment, variant calling, and annotation. Early genomics studies often struggled with reproducibility because pipelines were undocumented or dependent on specific computing environments (Kanwal et al., 2017).

The field has since embraced workflow managers like Snakemake and Nextflow, combined with containers for portability. For example, the nf-core project provides community-curated Nextflow pipelines that are fully versioned, containerized, and peer-reviewed (Ewels et al., 2020).

**Lesson:** Standardized, containerized workflows make it possible to reproduce genomic analyses across labs and platforms.

## 7.3 Climate Science: Sharing Simulation Data

Climate models produce petabytes of simulation data. Without careful management, these outputs are unusable beyond their original projects. To address this, the climate science community established the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), where modeling groups contribute results in standardized formats with rich metadata (Eyring et al., 2016).

These datasets, stored in open repositories and assigned DOIs, enable researchers worldwide to compare models, validate predictions, and conduct meta-analyses.

**Lesson:** Community standards for formats, metadata, and repositories enable large-scale collaboration and long-term reuse.

## 7.4 Social Sciences: Reusing Survey Data

In social sciences, surveys and experiments often produce datasets that are expensive and time-consuming to collect. Sharing these data multiplies their value.

Repositories such as the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) preserve and share social science datasets, with detailed documentation and controlled access for sensitive data. Studies show that shared datasets in social science are widely reused and lead to higher citation rates (Piwowar & Vision, 2013).

**Lesson:** Well-documented, accessible datasets amplify impact and support reproducibility in fields where data collection is costly.

## 7.5 Medicine: The Importance of Transparency in Clinical Research

Medicine has faced well-documented reproducibility challenges. Clinical trials often fail to publish raw data, making independent verification difficult. Initiatives like clinical trial registries and requirements from journals and funders for data and protocol sharing aim to address this (Zarin et al., 2011).

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted both the risks of poor transparency (e.g., retractions of studies with unverifiable data) and the benefits of rapid, open sharing of viral genomes and clinical trial protocols (Kupferschmidt, 2020).

**Lesson:** Transparency in medical research is not just an academic concern — it has direct consequences for public trust and health policy.

## 7.6 Computational Psychology: Replication with Open Code

The psychology replication crisis has drawn attention to the need for open data and code. Journals and researchers increasingly require preregistration of hypotheses and the sharing of analysis scripts.

Platforms like the Open Science Framework (OSF) support project preregistration, data sharing, and versioned code repositories (Nosek et al., 2015). Large replication projects coordinated through OSF have demonstrated both the challenges and the value of open science practices.

**Lesson:** Infrastructure that integrates preregistration, data, and code sharing helps address reproducibility crises.

## 7.7 Lessons Across Disciplines

Despite differences in scale and methods, common themes emerge:

- **Documentation is essential:** Whether sequencing data, climate models, or survey results, metadata and READMEs are critical.
- **Standards matter:** Shared formats and protocols enable large-scale reuse.
- **Tools support reproducibility:** Workflow managers, version control, and containers make analyses portable.
- **Openness increases impact:** Shared data and code lead to more citations and collaborations.
- **Culture is key:** Technical solutions succeed only when supported by community norms and incentives.

## 7.8 Reflection & Exercises

**Reflection:** Which case study resonates most with your own field? Why?

**Exercise:** Identify a repository commonly used in your discipline (e.g., GenBank, ICPSR, Zenodo). Explore how data and metadata are structured.

**Exercise:** Read a paper in your field that links to open data or code. Try to reproduce one result — what worked well, and what challenges did you encounter?

**Discussion prompt:** How could your research community adopt standards similar to those in genomics or climate science?

## 7.9 Looking Ahead

By examining real-world applications, we see that reproducibility is not theoretical — it is a practical challenge and an achievable goal. In the next chapter, we will conclude the course by drawing these threads together and outlining strategies for sustaining reproducible practices throughout a research career.
