# 6.5 Environment and Dependency Tools

As discussed in Chapter 4, managing environments is essential. Hands-on tools include:

- **Conda:** Cross-platform environment manager for Python and R.
- **virtualenv / venv:** Lightweight Python environment managers.
- **renv:** R package dependency manager.
- **Docker & Singularity:** Containerization for fully portable environments.

Researchers should practice creating, exporting, and sharing environments to ensure colleagues can reproduce results on different systems.
