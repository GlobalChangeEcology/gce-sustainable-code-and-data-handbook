# 6.3 Project Templates and Research Compendia

Organizing projects consistently saves time and prevents confusion. Tools such as Cookiecutter (for Python) and rrtools (for R) provide templates for reproducible research projects.

A research compendium (Gentleman & Temple Lang, 2007) is a structured bundle of:
- Data (raw and processed).
- Code (scripts, functions, notebooks).
- Documentation (README, metadata, methods).
- Outputs (figures, reports).

Using compendia ensures projects are portable and understandable to others â€” a concept increasingly adopted by journals and repositories.
