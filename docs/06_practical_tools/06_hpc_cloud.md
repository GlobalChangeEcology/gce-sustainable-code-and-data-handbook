# 6.6 Cloud Computing and High-Performance Clusters

Modern research often exceeds the capacity of personal laptops. Many institutions provide high-performance computing (HPC) clusters or cloud resources (AWS, GCP, Azure).

Key skills include:
- Submitting jobs to cluster schedulers (e.g., SLURM).
- Using SSH for remote access.
- Transferring data securely (e.g., `scp`, `rsync`).
- Scaling workflows using workflow managers (e.g., Snakemake, Nextflow).

Practical familiarity with HPC/cloud systems allows researchers to tackle larger datasets and more complex analyses.
