# 6.2 Command-Line Essentials

The command line remains one of the most powerful tools for scientific computing. Unlike graphical interfaces, it provides:

- **Automation:** Repeating tasks without manual clicking.
- **Transparency:** Commands can be logged and shared.
- **Efficiency:** Large-scale tasks (e.g., renaming hundreds of files) can be done in seconds.

Common tasks include:
- Navigating directories (`cd`, `ls`).
- Moving, copying, and renaming files (`mv`, `cp`).
- Searching (`grep`) and filtering (`awk`, `sed`).
- Writing reusable shell scripts for automation.

Proficiency in the shell is often the entry point to high-performance computing and cloud systems (Blischak et al., 2016).
