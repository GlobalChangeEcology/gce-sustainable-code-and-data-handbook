# Project Template Walkthrough

1. Copy the `project_template` folder to start a new project:
	```sh
	cp -r project_template my_new_project
	cd my_new_project
	```
2. Add your raw data to the `data/` folder.
3. Write analysis scripts in `scripts/` (use R or Python as needed).
4. Document your project in `docs/README.md` and update the main `README.md`.
5. Track your environment with `environment.yml` (Python) or `renv.lock` (R).

This structure helps keep your work organized and reproducible from the start.
