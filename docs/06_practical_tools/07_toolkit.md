# 6.7 Putting It All Together: A Daily Toolkit

A reproducible researcherâ€™s toolkit may include:

- Command line for automation and logging.
- Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration.
- DVC/Git LFS for data management.
- Conda/Docker for environment reproducibility.
- Snakemake/Nextflow for workflows.
- RMarkdown/Jupyter for reporting.

The goal is not to learn every tool at once, but to build skills gradually. Even adopting one or two tools can significantly improve reproducibility and efficiency.
