## 4.5 Workflow Management Systems

Scientific analyses often consist of multiple steps: preprocessing, filtering, analysis, visualization. Running these steps manually increases the risk of mistakes. Workflow management systems automate the process, ensuring steps run in the correct order and are fully documented.

Popular options include:

- **Make:** A classic tool for automating builds, adapted for science.
- **Snakemake (KÃ¶ster & Rahmann, 2012):** Inspired by Make, widely used in bioinformatics.
- **Nextflow (Di Tommaso et al., 2017):** Designed for scalable workflows on clusters and the cloud.
- **Common Workflow Language (CWL):** A standard for describing workflows.

These tools describe workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where each step depends on the outputs of previous steps. This ensures consistency and allows workflows to be resumed if interrupted.
