## 4.7 Best Practices for Workflow Reproducibility

Drawing on community guidelines (Sandve et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2017), best practices include:

- Keep raw data immutable — never overwrite it.
- Record every step — automate data cleaning and analysis.
- Track software versions — document environments.
- Use workflow managers to automate pipelines.
- Package environments in containers for portability.
- Generate reports programmatically from data and code.

Following these practices transforms a fragile workflow into a robust, transparent, and shareable system.
