## 4.6 Literate and Reproducible Reporting

A fully reproducible workflow does not stop at analysis — it extends to reporting. Literate programming combines code and narrative text, ensuring that figures, tables, and results are generated directly from the data.

- **RMarkdown and Quarto:** Integrate prose, code, and output.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Widely used for interactive analyses (Rule et al., 2019).
- **knitr (Xie, 2015):** Automates reproducible reports in R.

When manuscripts or reports are generated from the same workflow as the analyses, there is no risk of mismatched figures or “orphaned” results.
