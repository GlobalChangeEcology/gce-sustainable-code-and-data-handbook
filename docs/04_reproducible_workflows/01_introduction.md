# 4.1 Introduction: From Scripts to Workflows

Managing code and data individually is essential, but reproducibility also depends on how they fit together. A scientific project is not just a dataset and a script â€” it is a sequence of interconnected steps: collect data, clean it, analyze it, visualize results, and generate outputs. This sequence is a workflow.

Without careful management, workflows are often fragile. A missing dependency, an undocumented software version, or a notebook run out of order can make it impossible to reproduce results. Reproducible workflows ensure that scientific outputs can be regenerated reliably, by you or by others, regardless of time or place (Sandve et al., 2013).
