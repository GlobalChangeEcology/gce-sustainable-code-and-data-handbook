## 3.7 Testing and Continuous Integration

Errors in code can undermine entire research projects. Software engineering practices like testing are increasingly important in scientific code (Wilson et al., 2017).

- **Unit tests:** Check that individual functions behave as expected.
- **Integration tests:** Verify that multiple components work together.
- **Continuous integration (CI):** Automated services (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) run tests whenever code changes are pushed.

Testing increases trust in results and helps prevent silent errors from propagating.
