## 3.1 Introduction: Code as a Research Output

In modern science, code is no longer just a byproduct of research â€” it is an essential part of the research record. Scripts, pipelines, and analysis notebooks define how raw data is transformed into results. If this code is lost, undocumented, or poorly structured, the research itself becomes irreproducible (Wilson et al., 2017).

Treating code as a first-class research output, on par with papers and datasets, is therefore a cornerstone of reproducible science.
