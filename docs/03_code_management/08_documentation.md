## 3.3 Documentation Practices

Documentation is the bridge between code and people. At a minimum, this should include:

- **Inline comments:** Explain tricky steps, but avoid restating the obvious.
- **Docstrings:** Describe function inputs, outputs, and purpose.
- **README files:** Explain the structure of the repository, dependencies, and how to run analyses.
- **Usage examples:** Provide minimal working examples for others to test.

Without documentation, code may run â€” but it will not communicate.
