# From Notebooks to Reproducible Scripts

Notebooks (Jupyter, RMarkdown) are great for exploration, but can become messy. For reproducibility:

- Refactor exploratory code into functions and scripts.
- Use notebooks for reporting and visualization, not for core data processing.
- Export notebooks as scripts (`File > Download as > Script` in Jupyter; `knitr::purl()` in RMarkdown).
- Document the workflow and dependencies.
