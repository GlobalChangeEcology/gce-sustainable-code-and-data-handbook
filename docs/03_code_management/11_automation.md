## 3.6 Automation and Workflow Tools

As projects grow, manually running scripts in the right order becomes risky and inefficient. Workflow tools automate pipelines, ensuring analyses are reproducible and portable.

- **Make:** A classic tool for automating workflows.
- **Snakemake (KÃ¶ster & Rahmann, 2012):** Popular in bioinformatics, inspired by Make but adapted for modern science.
- **Nextflow:** Widely used for large-scale computational pipelines.

These tools capture dependencies between steps, so running `make` or `snakemake` automatically executes tasks in the right order.
