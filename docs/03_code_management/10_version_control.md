## 3.5 Version Control with Git

Version control systems track changes in code over time, making it possible to:

- Roll back mistakes.
- Collaborate without overwriting each other’s work.
- Maintain a history of the project.

Git is the most widely used system, with platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket providing hosting and collaboration features.

Core concepts include:

- **Commits:** Snapshots of changes.
- **Branches:** Parallel lines of development.
- **Merges:** Combining changes.
- **Pull requests:** Proposing and reviewing contributions.

Version control transforms code from a personal artifact into a collaborative, trustworthy record (Ram, 2013).
