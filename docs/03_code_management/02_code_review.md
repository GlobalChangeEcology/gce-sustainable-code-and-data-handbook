# Code Review

Peer code review helps catch errors and improve code quality. On GitHub or GitLab:

1. Push your changes to a feature branch.
2. Open a Pull Request (GitHub) or Merge Request (GitLab).
3. Ask a colleague to review your code, suggest changes, and approve before merging.

Tips:
- Be constructive and specific in feedback.
- Use comments to ask questions or clarify intent.
- Review for clarity, correctness, and documentation.
