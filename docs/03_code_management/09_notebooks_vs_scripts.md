## 3.4 Notebooks vs. Scripts

Interactive notebooks (e.g., Jupyter, RMarkdown) have become central in scientific workflows. They combine code, text, and results in a single document, making them ideal for exploration and communication (Rule et al., 2019).

However, notebooks can also encourage messy practices, such as running cells out of order or mixing exploratory and production code. A good rule of thumb is:

- Use notebooks for exploration and reporting.
- Use scripts and functions for reusable, automated workflows.
